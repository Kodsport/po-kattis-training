\problemname{Translation}
You just got a summer internship at a local translation bureau. However, the job is very buring. They refuse
to actually use the human mind to make translations; instead, they get ``optimal'' translations by directly
translating each word from a dictionary. Because this is extremely boring, you want to optimize your job
by writing a program.

You will be given a sentence in Swedish, and should translate it to English. You will also be given the
dictionary.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input containts the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^4$), the number of words in the
sentence.

The next line of input contains a sentence consisting of $N$ words in Swedish, the sentence that
you want to translate.

The following line contains the integer $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 10^4$), the number of word pairs in the dictionary.

Then follow $M$ lines, each containing a pair of words $a$ and $b$, which means that the Swedish word
$a$ should be translated to the english word $b$.

It is guaranteed that each $a$ is unique and that all words in the sentence to translate appears in the dictionary.
All words in the input consist of letters \texttt{a}-\texttt{z} and are at most 15 letters long.
Some of the words may not be real Swedish or English words.

\section*{Output}
Print the sentence, where each word has been translated from Swedish to English.
