\problemname{Mårten's DFS}
You will be given a simple, connected graph $G$ with $N$ vertices. Each vertex in $G$ has been numbered between $0$ and $N - 1$.

Determine if a list $L$ is a valid depth first-search order. A valid depth first-search order is one that can be generated by the following procedure, called with some argument between $0$ and $N - 1$:

\begin{verbatim}
DFS(start):
  print start
  seen[start] = true
  for each v : neighbours(start):
    if not seen[v]:
      DFS(v)
\end{verbatim}

Note that the neighbours to the vertex $v$ can be iterated through \emph{in any order} by Mårten's algorithm.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains two integers $1 \le N \le 100\,000$ and $0 \le E \le 300\,000$, the number of vertices and edges of $G$.

The next $E$ lines contains two integers $0 \le a, b \le N - 1$, describing an edge in $G$ between the vertices $a$ and $b$.

The final line will contain a space-separated list $L$ of (possible none) integers.

\section*{Output}
You should output \texttt{YES} if $L$ is a valid depth first-search order. Otherwise, you should output \texttt{NO}.

\section*{Grading}
Your solution will be graded on a number of subtasks. To get the points for a subtask, you must
be accepted on all test cases in the subtask.

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Subtask & Points & Limits    \\ \hline
    1     & 19         & $1 \le n \le 8$ and $1 \le m \le 28$ \\ \hline
    2     & 43         & $1 \le n \le 1\,000$ and $1 \le m \le 5\,000$ \\ \hline
    3     & 38         & $1 \le n \le 100\,000$ and $1 \le m \le 300\,000$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
