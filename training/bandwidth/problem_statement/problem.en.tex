\problemname{Bandwidth}
A computer network consists of $N$ computers with $M$ different direct links between some pairs of computers. Each link $i$ has a \emph{bandwidth} $b_i$ associated with it.

For a sequence of consecutive links $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$, the bandwidth of the sequence is the minimal bandwidth among all the invidual links. Thus a sequence of links with bandwidths $4, 3, 1, 2$ has bandwidth 1.

Given two computers $a$, $b$, we let $B(a, b)$ be the maximum possible bandwidth among all the possible link paths between $a$ and $b$. The \emph{minimum bandwidth} of the entire computer network is the minimum of $B(a, a)$ for all pairs of computers. So if $B(0, 1) = 1, B(1, 2) = 4, B(0, 2) = 3$, the minimum bandwidth is 1.


\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains two integers $1 \le N \le 100\,000$ and $0 \le M \le 300\,000$, the number of computers and links in the network.

The next $M$ lines contains three integers $0 \le a, b \le N - 1$ and $1 \le c \le 300\,000$, meaning that there is a direct link between the computers $a$ and $b$ with bandwidth $c$.

The input is always constructed so that there is a path of links between any pair of nodes.


\section*{Output}
You should output a single integer $B$ - the minimum bandwidth of the network.

\section*{Grading}
Your solution will be graded on a number of subtasks. To get the points for a subtask, you must
be accepted on all test cases in the subtask.

    Subtask & Points & Limits    \\ \hline
    1     & 23         & $2 \le n \le 8$ and $1 \le m \le 28$ \\ \hline
    2     & 30         & $2 \le n \le 1\,000$ and $1 \le m \le 5\,000$ \\ \hline
    3     & 47         & $2 \le n \le 100\,000$ and $1 \le m \le 300\,000$ \\ \hline
